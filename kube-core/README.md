# kube-core
Core traits and types necessary for interacting with the kubernetes API.
The rust counterpart to [kubernetes/apimachinery](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery).

## Usage
This crate is always re-exported from `kube` (even without features) under [`kube::core`](https://docs.rs/kube/*/kube/core/index.html).

## Docs
See the **[kube-core API Docs](https://docs.rs/kube-core/)**

## Development
Help very welcome! We need generic utilities, helpers like those in apimachinery, testing improvements, or just documentation. See https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/labels/core
