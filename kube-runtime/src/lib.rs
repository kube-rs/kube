//! Common components for building Kubernetes operators
//!
//! This crate contains the core building blocks to allow users to build
//! controllers/operators/watchers that need to synchronize/reconcile kubernetes
//! state.
//!
//! Newcomers are recommended to start with the [`Controller`] builder, which gives an
//! opinionated starting point that should be appropriate for simple operators, but all
//! components are designed to be usable รก la carte if your operator doesn't quite fit that mold.
