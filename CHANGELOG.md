[0.70.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/releases/tag/0.70.0) / 2022-03-20
===================
## Highlights

### [Support for EC keys with rustls](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/804)

This was one of the big blockers for using `rustls` against clusters like `k3d` or `k3s`
While __not sufficient__ to fix using those clusters out of the box, it is now __possible__ to use them [with a workarodund](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/153)

### [More ergonomic reconciler](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/851)
The signature and end the `Ok` action in `reconcile` fns has been simplified slightly, and requires the following user updates:

```diff
-async fn reconcile(obj: Arc<MyObject>, ctx: Context<Data>) -> Result<ReconcilerAction, Error> {
-    ...
-    Ok(ReconcilerAction {
-        requeue_after: Some(Duration::from_secs(300)),
-    })
+async fn reconcile(obj: Arc<MyObject>, ctx: Context<Data>) -> Result<Action, Error> {
+    ...
+    Ok(Action::requeue(Duration::from_secs(300)))
```

The `Action` import lives in the same place as the old `ReconcilerAction`.

===================
## Highlights

This is an emergency patch release fixing a bug in 0.69.0 where a `kube::Client` would deadlock after running inside a cluster for about a minute (#829).

All users of 0.69.0 are encouraged to upgrade immediately. 0.68.x and below are not affected.

<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.69.1 -->

## What's Changed

[0.69.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/releases/tag/0.69.0) / 2022-02-14
===================
## Highlights
### Ergonomic Additions to Api

Two new methods have been added to the client `Api` this release to reduce the amount of boiler-plate needed for common patterns.

- [`Api::entry`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/struct.Api.html#method.entry) via [811](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/811) - to aid idempotent crud operation flows (following the style of [`Map::Entry`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html#method.entry))
- [`Api::get_opt`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/struct.Api.html#method.get_opt) via [809](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/809) - to aid dealing with the `NotFound` type error via a returned `Option`

### [In-cluster Token reloading](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/768)

Following a requirement for Kubernetes clients against versions `>= 1.22.0`, our bundled [`AuthLayer`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.69.0/kube/client/middleware/struct.AuthLayer.html) will reload tokens every minute when deployed in-cluster.

<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.69.0 -->

* Add conversion for `ObjectRef<K>` to `ObjectReference` by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/815
* Add `Api::get_opt` for better existence handling by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/809
* Entry API by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/811
### Changed
* Reload token file at least once a minute by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/768

### Fixed
* Disable CSR utilities on K8s <1.19 by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/817

[0.68.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/releases/tag/0.68.0) / 2022-02-01
===================

### Interface Changes

To reduce the amount of allocation done inside the `runtime` by reflectors and controllers, the following change via [#786](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/786) is needed on the signature of your `reconcile` functions:

```diff
-async fn reconcile(myobj: MyK, ctx: Context<Data>) -> Result<ReconcilerAction>
+async fn reconcile(myobj: Arc<MyK>, ctx: Context<Data>) -> Result<ReconcilerAction>
```

This also affects the [finalizer helper](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/792).

### [Port-forwarding](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/446)

As one of the last steps toward [gold level client requirements](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/api-machinery/csi-new-client-library-procedure.md#client-capabilities), port-forwarding landed in [#446](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/446). There are 3 new [examples](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/tree/master/examples) (`port_forward*.rs`) that showcases how to use this websocket based functionality.

[0.66.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/releases/tag/0.66.0) / 2022-01-15
===================

Tons of ergonomics improvements, and 3 new contributors.
Highlighted first is the 3 **most discussed** changes:

### [Support for auto-generating schemas for enums in `kube-derive`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/779)

It is now possible to **embed complex enums** inside structs that use `#[derive(CustomResource)]`.

This has been a [highly requested feature](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/648) since the inception of auto-generated schemas. It does [not work for all cases](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/derive.CustomResource.html#enums), and has [certain ergonomics caveats](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/core/schema/struct.StructuralSchemaRewriter.html#method.visit_schema_object), but represents a huge step forwards.

Note that **if** you depend on `kube-derive` directly rather than via `kube` then you **must** now add the `schema` feature to `kube-core`

### [New `StreamBackoff` mechanism in `kube-runtime`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/703)

To avoid spamming the apiserver when on certain watch errors cases, it's now possible to [stream wrap](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/runtime/utils/struct.StreamBackoff.html) the `watcher` to set backoffs. The new [`default_backoff`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/runtime/watcher/fn.default_backoff.html) follows existing `client-go` conventions of being kind to the apiserver.

Initially, this is **default-enabled** in `Controller` watches (configurable via [`Controller::trigger_backoff`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/struct.Controller.html#method.trigger_backoff)) and avoids spam errors when crds are not installed.

### [New version priority parser in `kube-core`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/764)

To aid users picking the most appropriate version of a `kind` from [api discovery](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/discovery/index.html) or [through a CRD](https://github.com/kube-rs/kopium/), two new sort orders have been exposed on the new [`kube_core::Version`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/enum.Version.html)

- [`Version::priority`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/core/enum.Version.html#method.priority) implementing [kubernetes version priority](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#version-priority)
- [`Version::generation`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/core/enum.Version.html#method.generation) implementing a more traditional; generational sort (highest version)

## Changes

 * BREAKING: Removed `kube::Error::SslError` - [#704](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/704) and [#716](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/716)
 * BREAKING: Added `kube::Error::NativeTls(kube::client::NativeTlsError)` for errors from Native TLS - [#716](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/716)
 * BREAKING: Added `kube::Error::RustlsTls(kube::client::RustlsTlsError)` for errors from Rustls TLS - [#704](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/704)
 * Modified `Kubeconfig` parsing - allow empty kubeconfigs as per kubectl - [#721](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/721)
 * Added `Kubeconfig::from_yaml` - [#718](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/718) via [#719](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/719)
 * Updated `rustls` to 0.20.1 - [#704](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/704)
 * BREAKING: Added `ObjectRef` to the object that failed to be reconciled to `kube::runtime::controller::Error::ReconcileFailed` - [#733](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/733)

 * BREAKING: `kube-client`: replace `RefreshTokenLayer` with `AsyncFilterLayer` in `AuthLayer` - [#752](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/752)

[0.64.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/releases/tag/0.64.0) / 2021-11-16
===================

 * BREAKING: Replaced feature `kube-derive/schema` with attribute `#[kube(schema)]` - [#690](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/690)
   - If you currently disable default `kube-derive` default features to avoid automatic schema generation, add `#[kube(schema = "disabled")]` to your spec struct instead
 * BREAKING: Moved `CustomResource` derive crate overrides into subattribute `#[kube(crates(...))]` - [#690](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/690)
   - Replace `#[kube(kube_core = .., k8s_openapi = .., schema = .., serde = .., serde_json = ..)]` with `#[kube(crates(kube_core = .., k8s_openapi = .., schema = .., serde = .., serde_json = ..))]`
 * Added `openssl-tls` feature to use `openssl` for TLS on all platforms. Note that, even though `native-tls` uses a platform specific TLS, `kube` requires `openssl` on all platforms because `native-tls` only allows PKCS12 input to load certificates and private key at the moment, and creating PKCS12 requires `openssl`. - [#700](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/700)
 * BREAKING: Changed to fail loading configurations with PEM-encoded certificates containing invalid sections instead of ignoring them. Updated `pem` to 1.0.1. - [#702](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/702)
 * `oauth`: Updated `tame-oauth` to [0.6.0](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/tame-oauth/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#060---2021-08-07) which supports the same default credentials flow as the Go `oauth2` for Google OAuth. In addition to reading the service account information from JSON file specified with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default) from `gcloud`, and obtaining OAuth tokens from local metadata server when running inside GCP are now supported. - [#701](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/701)

### Refining Errors

We started working on improving error ergonomics. See the tracking issue [#688](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/688) for more details.

The following is the summary of changes to `kube::Error` included in this release:

* Added `Error::Auth(kube::client::AuthError)` (errors related to client auth, some of them were previously in `Error::Kubeconfig`)
* Added `Error::BuildRequest(kube::core::request::Error)` (errors building request from `kube::core`)
* Added `Error::InferConfig(kube::config::InferConfigError)` (for `Client::try_default`)
* Added `Error::OpensslTls(kube::client::OpensslTlsError)` (new `openssl-tls` feature) - [#700](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/700)
* Added `Error::UpgradeConnection(kube::client::UpgradeConnectinError)` (`ws` feature, errors from upgrading a connection)
* Removed `Error::Connection` (was unused)
* Removed `Error::RequestBuild` (was unused)
* Removed `Error::RequestSend` (was unused)
* Removed `Error::RequestParse` (was unused)
* Removed `Error::InvalidUri` (replaced by variants of errors in `kube::config` errors)
* Removed `Error::RequestValidation` (replaced by a variant of `Error::BuildRequest`)
* Removed `Error::Kubeconfig` (replaced by `Error::InferConfig`, and `Error::Auth`)
* Removed `Error::ProtocolSwitch` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)
* Removed `Error::MissingUpgradeWebSocketHeader` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)
* Removed `Error::MissingConnectionUpgradeHeader` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)
* Removed `Error::SecWebSocketAcceptKeyMismatch` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)
* Removed `Error::SecWebSocketProtocolMismatch` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)
* Removed `impl From<T> for Error`

<details>
<summary>Expand for more details</summary>

The following breaking changes were made as a part of an effort to refine errors (the list is large, but most of them are lower level, and shouldn't require much change in most cases):

* Removed `impl From<E> for kube::Error` - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/686)
* Removed unused error variants in `kube::Error`: `Connection`, `RequestBuild`, `RequestSend`, `RequestParse` - [#689](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/689)
* Removed unused error variant `kube::error::ConfigError::LoadConfigFile` - [#689](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/689)
* Changed `kube::Error::RequestValidation(String)` to `kube::Error::BuildRequest(kube::core::request::Error)`. Includes possible errors from building an HTTP request, and contains some errors from `kube::core` that was previously grouped under `kube::Error::SerdeError` and `kube::Error::HttpError`. `kube::core::request::Error` is described below. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/686)
* Removed `kube::core::Error` and `kube::core::Result`. `kube::core::Error` was replaced by more specific errors. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/686)
  - Replaced `kube::core::Error::InvalidGroupVersion` with `kube::core::gvk::ParseGroupVersionError`
  - Changed the error returned from `kube::core::admission::AdmissionRequest::with_patch` to `kube::core::admission::SerializePatchError` (was `kube::core::Error::SerdeError`)
  - Changed the error associated with `TryInto<AdmissionRequest<T>>` to `kube::core::admission::ConvertAdmissionReviewError` (was `kube::core::Error::RequestValidation`)
  - Changed the error returned from methods of `kube::core::Request` to `kube::core::request::Error` (was `kube::core::Error`). `kube::core::request::Error` represents possible errors when building an HTTP request. The removed `kube::core::Error` had `RequestValidation(String)`, `SerdeError(serde_json::Error)`, and `HttpError(http::Error)` variants. They are now `Validation(String)`, `SerializeBody(serde_json::Error)`, and  `BuildRequest(http::Error)` respectively in `kube::core::request::Error`.
* Changed variants of error enums in `kube::runtime` to tuples. Replaced `snafu` with `thiserror`. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/686)
* Removed `kube::error::ConfigError` and `kube::Error::Kubeconfig(ConfigError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
  - Error variants related to client auth were moved to a new error `kube::client::AuthError` as described below
  - Remaining variants were split into `kube::config::{InferConfigError, InClusterError, KubeconfigError}` as described below
* Added `kube::client::AuthError` by extracting error variants related to client auth from `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Moved `kube::error::OAuthError` to `kube::client::OAuthError` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Changed all errors in `kube::client::auth` to `kube::client::AuthError` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Added `kube::Error::Auth(kube::client::AuthError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Added `kube::config::InferConfigError` which is an error from `Config::infer()` and `kube::Error::InferConfig(kube::config::InferConfigError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Added `kube::config::InClusterError` for errors related to loading in-cluster configuration by splitting `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context. - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Added `kube::config::KubeconfigError` for errors related to loading kubeconfig by splitting `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context. - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Changed methods of `kube::Config` to return these erorrs instead of `kube::Error` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Removed `kube::Error::InvalidUri` which was replaced by error variants preserving context, such as `KubeconfigError::ParseProxyUrl` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)
* Moved all errors from upgrading to a WebSocket connection into `kube::Error::UpgradeConnection(kube::client::UpgradeConnectionError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/696)

0.56.0 / 2021-06-05
===================
 * `kube`: added `Api::default_namespaced` - [#209](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/209) via [#534](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/534)

  - `discovery`: moved `ApiResource` and `ApiCapabilities` (result of discovery) to `kube_core::discovery`
  - BREAKING: removed internal `ApiResource::from_apiresource`

 * `kube::Client` is now configurable with layers using `tower-http` [#539](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/539) via [#540](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/540)
  - three new examples added: [`custom_client`](./examples/custom_client.rs), [`custom_client_tls`](./examples/custom_client_tls.rs) and [`custom_client_trace`](./examples/custom_client_trace.rs)
  - Big feature streamlining, big service and layer restructuring, dependency restructurings
  - Changes can hit advanced users, but unlikely to hit base use cases with `Api` and `Client`.
  - In depth changes broken down below:

### TLS Enhancements

- Add `kube::client::ConfigExt` extending `Config` for custom `Client`. This includes methods to configure TLS connection when building a custom client [#539](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/539)
  - `native-tls`: `Config::native_tls_https_connector` and `Config::native_tls_connector`
  - `rustls-tls`: `Config::rustls_https_connector` and `Config::rustls_client_config`
- Remove the requirement of having `native-tls` or `rustls-tls` enabled when `client` is enabled. Allow one, both or none.
  - When both, the default Service will use `native-tls` because of [#153](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/153). `rustls` can be still used with a custom client. Users will have an option to configure TLS at runtime.
  - When none, HTTP connector is used.
- Remove TLS features from `kube-runtime`
  - **BREAKING**: Features must be removed if specified
- Remove `client` feature from `native-tls` and `rust-tls` features
  - `config` + `native-tls`/`rustls-tls` can be used independently, e.g., to create a simple HTTP client
  - **BREAKING**: `client` feature must be added if `default-features = false`

### Layers
- `ConfigExt::base_uri_layer` (`BaseUriLayer`) to set cluster URL (#539)
- `ConfigExt::auth_layer` that returns optional layer to manage `Authorization` header (#539)
- `gzip`: Replaced custom decompression module with [`DecompressionLayer`](https://docs.rs/tower-http/0.1.0/tower_http/decompression/index.html) from `tower-http` (#539)
- Replaced custom `LogRequest` with [`TraceLayer`](https://docs.rs/tower-http/0.1.0/tower_http/trace/index.html) from `tower-http` (#539)
  - Request body is no longer shown
- Basic and Bearer authentication using `AddAuthorizationLayer` (borrowing from https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-http/pull/95 until released)
- **BREAKING**: Remove `headers` from `Config`. Injecting arbitrary headers is now done with a layer on a custom client.

### Dependency Changes

- Remove `static_assertions` since it's no longer used
- Replace `tokio_rustls` with `rustls` and `webpki` since we're not using `tokio_rustls` directly
- Replace uses of `rustls::internal::pemfile` with `rustls-pemfile`
- Remove `url` and always use `http::Uri`
  - **BREAKING**: `Config::cluster_url` is now `http::Uri`
  - **BREAKING**: `Error::InternalUrlError(url::ParseError)` and `Error::MalformedUrl(url::ParseError)` replaced by `Error::InvalidUri(http::uri::InvalidUri)`

### 0.53.0 Migration Guide
The most likely issue you'll run into is from `kube` when using `Resource` trait which has been split:

```diff
+use kube::api::ResouceExt;
-    let name = Resource::name(&foo);
-    let ns = Resource::namespace(&foo).expect("foo is namespaced");
+    let name = ResourceExt::name(&foo);
+    let ns = ResourceExt::namespace(&foo).expect("foo is namespaced");
```

### 0.52.0 Migration Guide
While we had a few breaking changes. Most are to low level internal interfaces and should not change much, but some changes you might need to make:

#### kube
- if using the old, low-level `kube::api::Resource`, please consider the easier `kube::Api`, or look at tests in `request.rs` or `typed.rs` if you need the low level interface
- search replace `kube::api::Meta` with `kube::Resource` if used - trait was renamed
- if implementing the trait, add `type DynamicType = ();` to the impl
- remove calls to `ListParams::allow_bookmarks` (allow default)
- handle `WatchEvent::Bookmark` or set `ListParams::disable_bookmarks()`
- look at examples if replacing the long deprecated legacy runtime

#### kube-derive
The following constants from `k8s_openapi::Resource` no longer exist. Please `use kube::Resource` and:
- replace `Foo::KIND` with `Foo::kind(&())`
- replace `Foo::GROUP` with `Foo::group(&())`
- replace `Foo::VERSION` with `Foo::version(&())`
- replace `Foo::API_VERSION` with `Foo::api_version(&())`

0.51.0 / 2021-02-28

 * `kube-derive` now more robust and is using `darling` - [#435](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/435)
 * docs improvements to patch + runtime

0.50.1 / 2021-02-17
===================
 * bug: fix oidc auth provider - [#424](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/424) via [#419](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/419)

0.50.0 / 2021-02-10
===================
 * feat: added support for stacked kubeconfigs - [#132](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/132) via [#411](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/411)
 * refactor: authentication logic moved out of `kube::config` and into into `kube::service` - [#409](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/409)

0.49.0 / 2021-02-08
===================
 * dependency on `reqwest` + removed in favour of `hyper` + `tower` [#394](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/394)
   - refactor: `kube::Client` now uses `kube::Service` (a `tower::Service<http::Request<hyper::Body>>`) instead of `reqwest::Client` to handle all requests
   - refactor: `kube::Client` now uses a `tokio_util::codec` for internal buffering
   - refactor: `async-tungstenite` ws feature dependency replaced with `tokio-tungstenite`. `WebSocketStream` is now created from a connection upgraded with `hyper`
   - refactor: `oauth2` module for GCP OAuth replaced with optional `tame-oauth` dependency
   - BREAKING: GCP OAuth is now opt-in (`oauth` feature). Note that GCP provider with command based token source is supported by default.
   - BREAKING: Gzip decompression is now opt-in (`gzip` feature) because Kubernetes does not have compression enabled by default yet and this feature requires extra dependencies. [#399](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/399)
   - BREAKING: `Client::new` now takes a `Service` instead of `Config` [#400](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/400). Allows custom service for features not supported out of the box and testing. To create a `Client` from `Config`, use `Client::try_from` instead.
   - BREAKING: Removed `Config::proxy`. Proxy is no longer supported out of the box, but it should be possible by using a custom Service.
   - fix: Refreshable token from auth provider not refreshing
   - fix: Panic when loading config with non-GCP provider [#238](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/238)

  * bump `k8s-openapi` to `0.11.0` - [#388](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/388)
  * breaking: `kube`: no longer necessary to serialize patches yourself - [#386](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/pull/386)
    - `PatchParams` removes `PatchStrategy`
    - `Api::patch*` methods now take an enum `Patch` type
    - optional `jsonpatch` feature added for `Patch::Json`

  * Major API overhaul to support generic operations on `Object`
  * Api can be used to perform generic actions on resources:
    - `create`
    - `get`
    - `delete`
    - `watch`
    - `list`
    - `patch`
    - `replace`
    - `get_scale` (when scale subresource exists)
    - `patch_scale` (ditto)
    - `replace_scale` (ditto)
    - `get_status` (when status subresource exists)
    - `patch_status` (ditto)
    - `replace_status` (ditto)
  * crd_api example added to track the action api
  * Bunch of generic parameter structs exposed for common operations:
    - `ListParams` exposed
    - `DeleteParams` exposed
    - `PostParams` exposed
  * Errors from `Api` exposed in `kube::Error`:
    - `Error::api_error -> Option<ApiError>` exposed
    - Various other error types also in there (but awkward setup atm)
  * `client.request` now returns a tuple `(T, StatusCode)` (before only `T`)

0.6.0 / 2019-05-12
==================
  * Expose getter `Informer::version`
  * Exose ctor `Informer::from_version`
  * Expose more attributes in `Metadata`
  * `Informer::reset` convenience method added
  * `Informer::poll` no longer returns events straight
  * an `Informer` now caches `WatchEvent` elements into an internal queue
  * `Informer::pop` pops a single element from its internal queue
  * `Reflector::refresh` renamed to `Reflector::reset` (matches `Informer`)
  * `Void` type added so we can use `Reflector<ActualSpec, Void>`
    - removes need for Spec/Status structs:
    - `ReflectorSpec`, `ReflectorStatus` removed
    - `InformerSpec`, `InformerStatus` removed
    - `ResourceSpecMap`, `ResourceStatusMap` removed
  * `WatchEvents` removed
  * `WatchEvent` exposed, and now wraps `Resource<T, U>``

0.5.0 / 2019-05-09
==================
  * added `Informer` struct dedicated to handling events
  * Reflectors no longer cache `events` - see [#6](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube-rs/issues/6)

0.4.0 / 2019-05-09
==================
  * ResourceMap now contains the full Resource<T,U> struct rather than a tuple as the value. => `value.metadata` is available in the cache.
  * Reflectors now also cache `events` to allow apps to handle them

0.3.0 / 2019-05-09
==================
  * `Named` trait removed (inferring from metadata.name now)
  * Reflectors now take two type parameters (unless you use `ReflectorSpec` or `ReflectorStatus`) - see examples for usage
  * Native kube types supported via `ApiResource`
  * Some native kube resources have easy converters to `ApiResource`
