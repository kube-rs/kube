# Usage: configure your kubernetes context and run cargo tarpaulin
# Runs integration tests (--ignored) plus --lib tests on main crates
#
# NB: cargo tarpaulin -- --test-threads 1 (can help diagnose test interdependencies)
# NB: Tests should complete in about 30-60s after the compile
# NB: full recompiles happen every time: https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin/issues/777 even with --skip-clean
